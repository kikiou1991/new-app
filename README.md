This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

My biggest ongoing project at this time. As I learn and develop my skills I try and add more things to the project. I have run into a number of problems recently which I am researching at the moment how to solve.
